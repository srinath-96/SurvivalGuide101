## ü§ñ Gemini Fine-Tuning Instructions

### 1. Data Format
The `gemini_training_dataset.json` file contains training examples in the format:
```json
{
  "input_text": "Question: How do you purify water in the wilderness?",
  "output_text": "There are several methods to purify water...",
  "category": "Water",
  "type": "qa"
}
```

### 2. Training Types
- **`qa`**: Question-answer pairs for direct queries
- **`tutorial`**: Step-by-step guides for survival tasks  
- **`instruction`**: Process-oriented instructions
- **`information`**: General survival knowledge

### 3. Recommended Fine-Tuning Approach

#### A. Data Preparation
```python
import json

# Load training data
with open('data/structured/gemini_training_dataset.json', 'r') as f:
    training_data = json.load(f)

# Format for Gemini fine-tuning
formatted_data = []
for example in training_data:
    formatted_data.append({
        "input": example["input_text"],
        "output": example["output_text"],
        "category": example["category"]
    })
```

#### B. Training Configuration
- **Dataset Size**: 71 high-quality examples
- **Categories**: 7 survival domains  
- **Recommended Epochs**: 3-5 (small dataset)
- **Learning Rate**: Conservative (1e-5 to 1e-4)
- **Validation Split**: 80/20 train/validation

#### C. Prompt Engineering
Use survival-specific system prompts:
```
You are a wilderness survival expert. Provide accurate, life-saving advice for emergency situations. Always prioritize safety and include warnings when appropriate.
```

### 4. Testing Prompts

Test your fine-tuned model with these survival scenarios:

#### Basic Survival
- "I'm lost in the forest with no supplies. What should I do first?"
- "How do I start a fire when everything is wet?"
- "What are the signs that water is safe to drink?"

#### Emergency Situations  
- "A bear is approaching my campsite. What do I do?"
- "Someone in my group has hypothermia. How do I help?"
- "We're caught in a lightning storm while hiking. Where should we go?"

#### Practical Skills
- "How do I build a shelter that will keep me warm overnight?"
- "What plants can I eat if I'm stranded?"
- "How do I signal for rescue without equipment?"

## üìà Expected Outcomes

After fine-tuning with this dataset, your Gemini model should be able to:

‚úÖ **Provide accurate survival advice** for wilderness emergencies
‚úÖ **Give step-by-step instructions** for survival tasks  
‚úÖ **Identify dangerous situations** and provide safety warnings
‚úÖ **Answer specific questions** about water, fire, shelter, food, wildlife, navigation, and medical care
‚úÖ **Adapt advice** to different environmental conditions
‚úÖ **Prioritize immediate survival needs** over comfort

## üîß Continuous Improvement

### Expand the Dataset
To get even more training data, modify the scraper configuration:

1. **Increase article limits** in `config/scraping_config.py`
2. **Add more WikiHow articles** to the direct_articles list
3. **Run the scraper multiple times** to build a larger dataset
4. **Add specific scenarios** you want the model to handle

### Example Expansion
```python
# In run_scraper.py, increase limits:
results = orchestrator.run_full_pipeline(
    max_images=50,
    max_texts=1000  # Increase for more training data
)
```
