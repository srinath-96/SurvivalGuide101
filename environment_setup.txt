# Environment Setup for Survival Data Scraping

## Required Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the Survival_data directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Unsplash API Key (Get from: https://unsplash.com/developers)
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key_here

# Pexels API Key (Get from: https://www.pexels.com/api/)
PEXELS_API_KEY=your_pexels_api_key_here

# Optional: Delay between requests (seconds)
SCRAPING_DELAY=2

# Maximum images per query
MAX_IMAGES_PER_QUERY=50

# Maximum text articles per source
MAX_ARTICLES_PER_SOURCE=30
```

## How to Get API Keys:

1. **Unsplash API Key:**
   - Go to https://unsplash.com/developers
   - Create an account or sign in
   - Create a new application
   - Copy the "Access Key"

2. **Pexels API Key:**
   - Go to https://www.pexels.com/api/
   - Create an account or sign in
   - Generate an API key
   - Copy the API key

## Note:
If you don't have API keys, the scraper will automatically use fallback methods that don't require keys.
It will scrape from:
- Wikimedia Commons (Creative Commons licensed images)
- Government sources (Public domain images)
- Other free sources

## Load Environment Variables:
Add this to your main script:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```
